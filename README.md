# AndroidApplicationSkeleton
An application skeleton to bootstrap your next Android app instantly

## The Lazy Idea

The main idea of this project is that's Im very lazy :) 
Bootstrapping a new app from scratch is a kind of pain - you have to create a base gradle project,
setup commonly used deps, write commonly used code such as App class, base activities, plug in
event bus, plug in themes, material design tweaks, etc, etc, etc. And this repeats from project to project !

So the main goal of this skeleton is to speed up the new app bootstrapping process. To delete smth
is always faster than to create smth :)

So, this project is just a skeleton with:

- Nice gradle project structure
- Pre-configured modules for mobile app and its wear app companion
- Pre-configured commonly used deps
- Pre-configured app signing infrastructure
- Examples package from where you can copy-paste the code


## Quick Start

- Copy this project into your new app project folder
- Open in Android Studio
- Change the package name to fit your new app
- Remove the unneeded deps, add your specific deps
- Start coding the actual app logic instead of configuring the build


More docs will come later, this skeleton is still in progress, stay tuned !
